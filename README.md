# Features
Impact is a fully functional iOS application that aims to help individuals in need by crowdsourcing funds from users of the application.  We use Plaid API to round up each purchase made and donate the cents to a person each user chooses to impact.  Once impacting an individual, the user can either automatically have their rounded up purchases donated or they can manually donate them whenever they want to.  One value proposition of this application is that when someone donates to charity, it is rare they know exactly where their funds are going, but with Impact, they can find someone to support that they connect with. For example, our first two individuals on the platform were Indiya Baker and Miles Covington. Both love lacrosse but didn't have the money to pay for their own equipment.  We connected with these individuals because everyone working on Impact participates in Collegiate Varsity Athletics. 
Another value proposition for Impact is that many people struggle to find time to devote to donating to charity.  With our seamless platform, they can select an individual and continually contribute to them while getting status updates and blogposts along the way.
