Background
Delavidah, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company” or “we” “us” or “our”) has developed, and continues to upgrade and improve, certain applications, software and processes (each, in whatever form, an “Application”) allowing users to round-up purchases or charges on credit cards, debit cards, payment apps or other forms of digital or electronic payment to the next highest dollar (or other monetary) amount and use such rounded up amounts to contribute to Designated Recipients, to fund a designated individual or organization or to allocate their use for other purposes (each, a “Designated Recipient”).   The Company owns and operates the Application for its own account.   
The Application is currently named “Impact,” but we reserve the right to change the name of the Application.   Through the Application the Company may link you, or allow direct contact, with a Designated Recipient.  Use, and disclosure, of donations to the Designated Recipient are governed by the rules and laws applicable to such Designated Recipient.  In its start-up phase the Company does not plan on charging the Designated Recipient any administrative, user or other fees in connection with donations made, or information or data services provided, using the Application.  The Company reserves the right to enter into fee agreements with Designated Recipients in the future.  
These Terms of Use apply to all uses of the Application and any of the Company’s websites (collectively, the “Sites”) and to any electronic, written or oral communications with the Company regardless of the platform for such communications (each, a “Platform”).  “Platform” includes  web sites and any device on, or through, which an Application is, could be, accessible or used, including, but not limited to, mobile phones, computers, smart tv’s, tablets and any other form of implementation.   
Your Agreement by using the Application or Sites  
Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you download, install or use the Application or register on any of the Company’s Sites. By downloading, installing or using the Application or registering on any Site, you indicate that you accept these Terms of Use and that you agree to abide by them. Your download, installation or use of the Application, or registration on a Site, constitutes your acceptance of these Terms of Use which takes effect on the date on which you download, install or use the Application or on which you register on a Site.   If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, you should cease downloading, installing or using the Application immediately or cease registration at a Site.
We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use at any time without notice to you by posting changes on http://www.impactapp.net or by updating the Application to incorporate the new terms of use. You are responsible for regularly reviewing information posted online to obtain timely notice of such changes. Your continued use of the Application or Sites after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the amended Terms of Use.

Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy addresses the practices of the Company regarding information collected from you, as a user of any of the Company’s Platforms or in communications with the Company.  
 The Company can be contacted by email at info@impactapp.net 
A.	Collection of Information
In connection your use of an Application or Sites or in communicating with the Company (whether orally, in writing or digitally), the Company may collect or track: (a) your email addresses; (b) information you knowingly provide in online forms or registrations and other communications with Company; (c) aggregate and user-specific information regarding uses of Company websites and Applications; (d) the home server domain names, date and time of your visit, type of computer, the originating IP address, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser used; and (e) for users who opt-in to the location function (described in greater detail in below), the location(s) at which you use an Application.  The Company may use a third party analytics service to gather, store, and track certain information related to your visit to and activity on the Company websites and/or your use of an Application.
The Company may place Internet “cookies” on your hard drive. Internet cookies are small amounts of data that contain a unique identifier that many websites frequently send to your web browser to be stored on your computer’s hard drive in order to save data about you, such as your name, password, user-name, screen preferences, and the pages of a website you have viewed. When you revisit Company websites or open or use an Application, the Company may recognize you by your Internet cookies and customize your experience accordingly. You may decline Internet cookies by using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available. 
When a user performs a search within the Company’s websites (collectively, the “Sites”), the Company may record information identifying the user or linking the user to the search performed and recording information related to the search request. The collection, use, and disclosure of information contemplated in this Privacy Policy may involve a transfer of the information to jurisdictions located outside your country of residence that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding personally identifiable information.
B.	Use of Personal Information Collected.   The Company may use your personal information collected for any reason, including, recordkeeping, marketing and promotional purposes, statistical analysis of your online behavior, user satisfaction and Application improvements. Aggregate data on your home servers may be used for internal purposes.  Your individual identifying information, such as your name, postal and email addresses and phone numbers which you voluntarily provide to the Company may be added to the Company’s databases and used for future communications, whether orally, written or digital.   The Company also may use user data to contact you regarding registration and account status and changes to these Terms of Use or any other policies or agreements relevant to users of the Sites or Applications.

C.	Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties. Except as provided herein, individually identifying personal information provided through the Sites or Application will not be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties not affiliated with Company.  Identifiable and non-identifiable user information and data may be disclosed or distributed to another party with which Company enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, or if determined by Company in its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health, or property of Company or any other person or entity.  Identifiable and non-identifiable user information and data that users provide to Company may also be provided to third parties that contract with Company to provide products, information or other services that Company believes that users may be interested in obtaining. While Company may undertake efforts to see that any third party to whom Company discloses personal information is under an obligation to use the personal information solely for the purposes for which the information was disclosed, such third parties are independent third parties over which Company exercises no control. Company is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, the conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices of third parties.

Any comment system on the Sites or the Application may utilize an opt-in Geolocation service in accordance with a prevailing community standard such as HTML 5.  Such Geolocation opt-in ability is managed by the user’s browser settings.  If a user chooses to opt-in to the Geolocation service, the user’s comments may be associated with the user’s location, both internally within Company and publicly on the Sites or the Application.
